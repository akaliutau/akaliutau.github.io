I'm a software engineer with more than a decade of experience, expert knowledge of ML/AI (Deep Learning, LLM, GAN, RAG) and exceptional skills in building intelligent systems at scale. My work focuses on robotics, industrial ML and AI technologies, cloud technologies, intelligent automation, and AI research. I bridge research and engineering, hardening prototypes into secure, scalable, and production-ready systems. I received my Masters in Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London in 2025.
